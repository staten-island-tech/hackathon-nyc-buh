could you add enemies with their individual hps and the explosion should damage them, these enemies should be able to move.

make it so if i hold down my mouse i can charge up a ammo that becomes bigger and eventually switches to a different image

add types of ammo:
- normal
- bouncy
- laser

the normal ammo should maintain what type of attacks are currently in the script
the bouncy ammo should do another bezier curve towards a random direction while also being able to be charged, the longer the charge, the bouncier and larger it is
the lazer should just be held down for a constant beam


could you intregrate 3d aspects to this html and make the player be able to move around, it should have object permeance, make sure not to alter the main gameplay, it should still have enemies you can throw explosive bullets at.

could you make it so i can turn the camera using arrow left and right?

could you decorate the surroundings with buildings resembling new york

the buildings should just be in the background and have no real impact on the game, the enemies should also throw projectiles at the player
make different enemy types
- one that throws multiple projectiles
- one that calls for more enemies
- one that throws explosives
